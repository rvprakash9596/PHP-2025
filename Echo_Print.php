echo"<h1><center>PHP echo and print Statements .</center></h1><br>
echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.

The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. <br>
echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument.
echo is marginally faster than print.";

print("<br>Hello PHP ");
